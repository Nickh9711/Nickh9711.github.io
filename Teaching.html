    <p> <i> How to Solve It </i> (G.Polya, 1945) introduced a four-phased method to solve any 
      mathematical problem. The four phases are understanding the problem, 
      devising a plan, carrying out the plan, and looking back. I am working
      to adapt this method when teaching mathematics. "What is the definition?" is the first
      question I will always ask when looking at a mathematical problem. Learning mathematics 
      requires the efforts from both the student and the teacher. The teacher will offer paths 
      to students and keep them highly motivated on the way, but the students should be responsible
      for their own studies. If you want to see more about my philosophy of teaching, you can check out
