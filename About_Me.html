    <p> My name is Nick (Zhiyong) Huang. I am a graduate teacher candidate at the University of Toronto, Ontario Institute for Studies in Education (OISE),
        pursuing my Masters in Teaching.

    <p>
      <i> How to Solve It </i> (G.Polya, 1945) introduced a four-phased method to solve any 
          mathematical problem. The four phases are understanding the problem, 
          devising a plan, carrying out the plan, and looking back. I am working
          to adapt this method when teaching mathematics. "What is the definition?" is the first
          question I will always ask when looking at a mathematical problem. Learning mathematics 
          requires the efforts from both the student and the teacher. The teacher will offer paths 
          to students and keep them highly motivated on the way, but the students should be responsible
          for their own studies. If you want to see more about my philosophy of teaching, you can check out
          my <a href = "document/Teaching Statement.pdf">teaching statement</a> and the <a href="Teaching.html"> teaching page</a>.
