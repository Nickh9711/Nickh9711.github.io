      <h2>Teaching</h2>
      <p> <i> How to Solve It </i> (G.Polya, 1945) introduced a four-phased method to solve any 
          mathematical problem. The four phases are understanding the problem, 
          devising a plan, carrying out the plan, and looking back. I am working
          to adapt this method when teaching mathematics. "What is the definition?" is the first
          question I will always ask when looking at a mathematical problem. Learning mathematics 
          requires the efforts from both the student and the teacher. The teacher will offer paths 
          to students and keep them highly motivated on the way, but the students should be responsible
          for their own studies. If you want to see more about my philosophy of teaching, you can check out

                      “Linear algebra is so much different from the math that I have learned in high school.” 
                      This is a sentence that was said by many university students in their first years. Previous 
                      studies have shown that understanding concepts, use of suitable notations in 
                      communicating ideas and attitude towards mathematics are major factors that contribute 
                      to learning linear algebra. In our study, quantitative and qualitative research is conducted 
                      on a class of first year students taking linear algebra at the University of Toronto, 
                      Scarborough in order to investigate the impact of mastery in reciting definitions, and the 
                      ability to identify and come up examples and counter examples for a particular concept
                      in students’ ability to communicate in mathematics. It is not surprising that significant 
                      correlations have been found between understanding definition and writing a proof in 
                      linear algebra. However, the story turns out to be more complicated and there are 
                      multiple factors with different levels of impact in the students’ performance. Overall, even
                      though our study supports definition focus approaches to linear algebra, it suggests that 
                      focusing on multiple representations on concepts can further improve students learning.
