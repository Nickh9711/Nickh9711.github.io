    <h2> <b> MATB61_TUT0003/4 Linear Programming and Optimization </b> </h1>
        Welcome to the homepage for MATB61 tutorial sections TUT0003 and TUT0004 at the University of Toronto Scarborough, winter 2021.
        Tutorial notes and sample quiz solutions will be posted here. Important
        announcements and the zoom link will be posted on the Quercus page. The course description from the UTSC calendar can be found
        <a href="https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/matb61h3"> here</a>. Please let me know if you have any 
        <a href="https://forms.gle/Qyn4gU3dgdYEQrgc6"> suggestions or feedbacks</a>. The main purpose of the tutorial
        is to help you understand the concepts that are taught in lectures by briefly going over the concepts again and doing
        practice problems. The four-phased method introduced by G.Polya in his book <i> How to Solve It </i> at 1945 will be applied
        when teaching. More information about the method and myself can be found in the <a href="index.html">home</a> page.
        <h5> <b> How to academically succeed in this course: </b> </h5>
            Understand the concepts and algorithms by proving not just seeing. Do the practice problem even though some of them
            are relatively easy.
        <h5> <b> Tutorial Notes: </b> </h5> <!-- Tutorial Notes -->
            The tutorial notes will be posted here before the tutorial and the annotated note will be
            updated after the class.
