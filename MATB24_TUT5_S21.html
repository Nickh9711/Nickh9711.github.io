    <h2> <b> MATB24_TUT5 Linear Algebra II </b> </h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to the homepage for MATB24 tutorial sections TUT5 at the University of Toronto Scarborough, summer 2021.
        Tutorial notes will be posted here. Important
        announcements and the zoom link will be posted on the Quercus page. The course description from the UTSC calendar can be found
        <a href="https://utsc.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/matb24h3"> here</a>.

      <p>
        The main purpose of the tutorial
        is to help you understand the concepts that are taught in lectures by briefly going over the concepts again and doing
        practice problems. In particular, I will focus on improving your proof writing skills and the understanding of the definitions. Our recent research for math education in linear algebra
        shows a significant correlation between understanding definition and writing a proof in linear algebra. More information about the research can be found in the <a href="index.html">home</a> page.
      </p>

      <p>
        The four-phased method introduced by G.Polya in his book <i> How to Solve It </i> at 1945 will be applied
        when teaching. The method will provide you with a step-by-step guidances in approaching to solve a mathematical problem. A summary of the method can be found in the Wikipedia page
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It"> here</a> . More information about my teaching philosophy can be found in the <a href="index.html">home</a> page.
      </p>


        <h5> <b> How to academically succeed in this course: </b> </h5>
            Understand the concepts and algorithms by proving not just seeing. Do the practice problem even though some of them
            are relatively easy. Practice your proof writing skill and be precise in your proof. The hypothesis and conclusion should
            always be easily identified in your proof.
